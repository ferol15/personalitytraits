<i>Big Five Personality Traits</i> theory is one of the most recent and widely accepted approaches in political psychology scholarship to enclose the links between personality traits and political beliefs. <i>Big Five Personality Traits</i> research employs lexical analysis by asking individuals about a certain set of personality adjectives’ fitness to their personality attributes, and later, applies exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to those questions to identify broader personality traits domains (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann Jr, 2003; Gerber, Huber, Doherty and Dowling, 2011). 

Accordingly, <i>Big Five Personality Traits</i> theory puts forward the following five personality traits: (i) <i>Extraversion</i>, (ii) <i>Agreeableness</i>, (iii) <i>Conscientiousness</i>, (iv) <i>Neuroticism</i> (or <i>Emotional Instability</i>) and (v) <i>Openness to New experiences</i>. In our current study, we want to ascertain the extent of Openmindedness-related differences in several political attitudes and behaviors (for a brief illustration of each trait’s dimensions, please see Figure 1).
